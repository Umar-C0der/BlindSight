Visually impaired individuals face obstacles in navigating their surroundings
independently, limiting their mobility and participation in daily life. Existing assistive
technologies often lack real-time, context-aware guidance. Thus, there's a pressing need
for an innovative Intelligent Assistive Navigation System[5] to provide accurate, realtime information, enhance safety, and promote independence for this community.
Although there are systems available to tackle this problem but these systems do not
detect obstacles in run-time and navigate to avoid these obstacles.
The system is for Visually impaired individuals. The visually impaired individuals face
obstacles moving from one place to another. Whenever they move from one place to
another the obstacle may harm them. The issue is occurring in the way moving from one
place to another. Fixing the problem of limited independent navigation for visually
impaired individuals is vital as it promotes inclusivity and independence. It directly
improves the quality of life for customers and stakeholders by enhancing safety, mobility,
